kiss-rs is currently *WIP*.

unlike original kiss, kiss-rs commands are seperate binaries(like: kiss-build, kiss-install, kiss-checksum etc.).

** completed commands
- [X] build
- [X] checksum
- [X] download
- [-] install(bugs are expected)
- [X] list
- [X] search

** TODO Fix Issues
- [-] pkg_conflicts:
  - [ ] enable alternatives automatically if it is safe to do so.
  - [ ] fix bugs(like Found conflict: /var/db/kiss/installed/rust-analyzer/version)
- [ ] pkg_{install, remove}_files:
  - [ ] installing/removing some files fails
- [X] log!/die!: improve macros
- [-] pkg_depends:
  - [ ] add circular dependency checks
  - [X] fix bugs(sometimes it does not detect some deps)
- [ ] replace all .expect(s) with appropriate error management

** using provides system
- open /var/db/kiss/provides file using your favourite editor:
  #+begin_src shell
    doas vim /var/db/kiss/provides
#+end_src
- syntax is like this: <package> <replacement>
- Later i will write an cli app to add/remove replacements to provides file
